Many thanks to Greg Hartman for his huge amount of help with the \LaTeX\ layout.\\

Thanks to students for finding errors in the drafts leading up to this text, including Chris Fraser, Stephen States, Heather Chichura and Joey Bishop.\\

The \LaTeX\ community has provided a large amount of online (and free!) assistance, including MiK\TeX and \TeX nicCenter.  These are flexible and powerful tools that allowed me to produce a text with just the look I wanted.  Many thanks.

%This text took a great deal of effort to accomplish and I owe a great many people thanks. \\

%%I owe Michelle (and Sydney and Alex) much for their support at home. Michelle puts up with much as I continually read \LaTeX\ manuals, sketch outlines of the text, write exercises, and draw illustrations.\\
%%
%%My thanks to the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Virginia Military Institute for their support of this project. Lee Dewald and Troy Siemers, my department heads, deserve special thanks for their special encouragement and recognition that this effort has been a worthwhile endeavor.\\
%%
%%My thanks to the cadets of VMI for their enthusiastic use of the text (and appreciation of the price). Special thanks to Michelle Feole as she caught a number of errors.\\
%%
%%This whole project would have been impossible save for the efforts of the \LaTeX\ community. This text makes use of about 15 different packages, was compiled using MiK\TeX, and edited using \TeX nicCenter, all of which was provided free of charge. This generosity helped convince me that this text should be made freely available as well.

%I did this myself, so no one to thank.
