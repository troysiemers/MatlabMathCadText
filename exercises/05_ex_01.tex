{The height of a projectile is given by
\[
f(t) = -\frac{9.8}{2} t^2 + 147 t + 500, \quad t>0
\] 
Create the function \cour{ProjMotion} that has one input, \cour{time}, and two outputs \cour{height} and \cour{velocity}. 
%\item Use the output of the function to plot \cour{time} versus \cour{height} for 0 to 30 seconds in increments of 0.5 seconds.\\
%\item Use the output of the function to figure out at what time the object starts to fall back to the ground.
