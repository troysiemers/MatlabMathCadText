{Find the following integrals.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] The area under the bell curve between -1 and 1 represents the percentage of a population that is one standard deviation away from the mean (or 68.3\%).  Show this is true by approximating the integral 
\[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}}\int_{-1}^1 e^{-x^2/2} \; dx.\]
\item[b.] The area between the cardioid $r=1+\cos\theta$ and the circle $r=1$ is given by the polar integral
\[\displaystyle \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \int_1^{1+\cos\theta} r \; dr d\theta.\]
Find the exact value of this integral using the exact variables $r$ and $\theta$.
\item[c.] The volume of the solid bounded by the sphere of radius 1 (centered at the origin) and the cone $\phi=\pi/3$ is given by 
\[\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi/3} \int_0^1 \rho^2 \sin \phi \; d\rho d\phi d\theta.\] 
Find the exact value of this integral, using the exact variables $\rho,\phi$ and $\theta$.
\end{enumerate}}
