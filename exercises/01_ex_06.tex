{In considering Stirling's formula, since the numbers grow so quickly in using the factorial, it can be advantageous to use the natural logarithm function.  A related approximation is given by $\ln (n!) \approx n \ln n - n$.  Compute the difference $\ln (n!) -( n \ln n - n)$ for $n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50$.  What is the largest value of $n$ that Matlab will allow in this difference calculation?}
