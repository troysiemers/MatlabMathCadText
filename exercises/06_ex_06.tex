{Data on unemployment percentages (per month) during 2000-2010 is in a file called \cour{UnemploymentByYear.xlsx} (in the Appendix in Table \ref{table:Unemployment} and saved on Angel).  First save this file to a directory on your computer and then use the command \cour{xlsread} to load this file.  Note that the first row of the file is text so you will only want to load the information on rows 2 through 12.  Assign the data in the file to a variable of your choice.  Since the data for December 2010 has not been entered, correct it (in Matlab) with the correct value (look it up online).  Next, create a plot of month versus unemployment (including appropriate titles and labels on the axes).  Your plot should have 11 curves, one for each year and in different colors.  Include a legend in your plot for reference (labelled correctly).}
