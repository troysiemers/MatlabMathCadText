{The volume of a truncated pyramid with a square base is given by $V=\frac{1}{3} (a^2 + ab +b^2)h$ where $h$ is the height, $a$ is the length of one of the sides of the base and $b$ is the length of the sides of one of the top (also a square).  
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Find the volume if $a=5 ft, b=3ft, h=10 ft$ by first defining $a, b$ and $h$ as separate variables and then defining $V$ in terms of them.
\item[b.] In part a, the solution is probably in liters.  Convert the answer to $ft^3$.
\end{enumerate}
