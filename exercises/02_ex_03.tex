{Counterclockwise rotation in two dimensions (about the origin) can be done through matrix multiplication (multiplying on the left) by the matrix

\[
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos \theta & - \sin \theta\\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta
\end{array}
\right]
\]

Rotate the point $(x,y) = (-2,3)$ counterclockwise about the origin by each of $\theta = 30^{\circ}, 90^\circ$ and $200^\circ$ and give the final positions in each case.}
