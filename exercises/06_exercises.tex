When you submit this assignment, there should be three separate files.  Problems 1 and 2 should be in their own function m-files (properly commented of course).  Problems 3-6 should be a separate script m-file that uses the code from the first 2 problems and Excel spreadsheets on Angel.  As usual, make sure each of your file names start with your VMI id.
