{For a continuous money stream, we have the equation $F=P e^{rt}$ where $F$ is final value, $r$ is the interest rate, $P$ is the principal, and $t$ is time.  Use the \cour{meshgrid} and the \cour{exp} commands to find possible values of $F$ for $P$ ranging from $10,000$ to $50,000$ (in increments of $10,000$) and $t$ ranging from 0 to 10 (in increments of 1).  You can select the value of $r$, but use a reasonable, real-world interest rate (explain how you chose your value of $r$ too).}
