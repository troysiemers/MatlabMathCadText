{In this problem, you will see part of Cardano's formula for solving a cubic equation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Using the bold equals sign (a symbolic equals), write out the general form of a cubic equation $a x^3 + bx^2 + cx +d\ \boldeq \ 0$.
\item[b.] The ``discriminant'' of the cubic equation in part a is defined as \[\Delta \ \boldeq \ 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 -4ac^3-27a^2d^2\] Using symbolic equals 
\& Greek toolbar write this equation in your worksheet. 
\item[c.] Existence of solutions to the cubic equation will depend on the value of $\Delta$ in part b.  In one particular case, it is important that $\Delta$ be negative. In the case that $a,b,c$ and $d$ all have value 1, show that $\Delta$ is negative.  First define $a$ through $d$ and then write $\Delta$ in terms of them.   
\item[d.] When $\Delta$ is negative (like in part c), one solution is (all one line): 
\begin{align*}
x=-\frac{b}{3a}
&-\frac{1}{3a}\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}\left[2b^3-9abc+27a^2d+\sqrt{(2b^3-9abc+27a^2d)^2-4(b^2-3ac)^3} \right]}\\
&-\frac{1}{3a}\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}\left[2b^3-9abc+27a^2d-\sqrt{(2b^3-9abc+27a^2d)^2-4(b^2-3ac)^3} \right]}
\end{align*}
In the case where $a,b,c$ and $d$ are all 1, compute this root. (Hint: Try using ctrl + Enter in the middle)
\item[E.C.] What are the other two roots?  (Hint: Look at the Mathcad ``factor'' function).
\end{enumerate}
