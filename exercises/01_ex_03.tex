{The volume of a truncated pyramid with a square base is given by 
\[
V=\frac{1}{3} (a^2 + ab +b^2)h
\] 
where $h$ is the height, $a$ is the length of one of the sides of the base and $b$ is the length of the sides of one of the top (also a square).  Find the volume if $a=5, b=3, h=10$ by first defining $a, b$ and $h$ as separate variables and then defining $V$ in terms of them.}
