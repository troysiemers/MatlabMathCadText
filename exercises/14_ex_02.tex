{A square matrix $A$ is called {\bf nilpotent} if some power of the matrix is equal to the zero matrix, i.e. $A^n=0$ for some integer $n$.  The smallest such $n$ is called the {\bf degree} of $A$.  Consider the matrix 
\[
A
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 1 & 0&0\\
0 & 0 & 1 &0\\ 
0 & 0 &  0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Show that $A$ is nilpotent, and find its degree.
\item[b.] The eigenvalues of any nilpotent matrix are all zero.  Confirm this by finding the eigenvalues of $A$.
\item[c.] Find a matrix that is nilpotent with order 10.
\item[E.C.] Give (or describe) a matrix that is nilpotent with order 2011.

\end{enumerate}
