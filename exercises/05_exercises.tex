When you submit this assignment, there should be seven separate files.  Problems 1-6 should be in their own function m-files (properly commented of course).  Problem 7 should be a separate script m-file that uses the code from the first 6 problems.  Make sure each of your files starts with your VMI id (mine would be \cour{siemerstjFunction}).
