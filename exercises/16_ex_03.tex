{Suppose that a population, P, grows over time, t, according to exponential growth with the following data.
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Time (years) } & {\bf Population (thousands)} \\ \hline
1&	1.61\\ \hline
2&	2.51\\ \hline
3&	2.17\\ \hline
4&	6.14\\ \hline
5&	6.81\\ \hline
6&	17.53\\ \hline
7&  16.36\\ \hline
8&  25.04\\ \hline
9&  39.61\\ \hline
10 &  55.50\\ 
\hline
\end{array}
\]
We have that the population is therefore growing according to the equation $P = P_0 e^{kt}$.  Taking a logarithm, we can convert this into $\ln(P) = \ln(P_0) + kt$ (i.e. $\ln(P)$ is linear in $t$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Plot the data with $t$ on the horizontal axis and $\ln(P)$ on the vertical axis.
\item[b.] Find the slope and intercept for the data in part a and then create a new plot with this regression line and the data in part a.
\end{enumerate}}
