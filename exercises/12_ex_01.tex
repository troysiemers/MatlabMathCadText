{In this exercise, we apply both given/find and solve techniques to a quadratic equation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Use the solve command to find the solutions to $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$.
\item[b.] Create a given/find setup for the equation $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$ similar to the example at the beginning of this section.  
Find the value of $x$ using the different the seed values $10,-5$ and $-2.5$.  What is special about the seed value $-2.5$?  
\end{enumerate}}
