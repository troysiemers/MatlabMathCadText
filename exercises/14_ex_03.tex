{ The $L_2$ condition number of a matrix is given by the 2-norm of the matrix times the 2-norm of the inverse of the matrix (written $||A||_2 \cdot ||A^{-1}||_2$)
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Find the condition number of $H_5$ from problem~1. Look in the help files for the correct command.
\item[b.] Find a value of $x$ so that the following matrix $C$ has $L_2$ condition number as close to 100 as possible.  Guess and check.
\[
C
=
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
x & 2 & 2\\
2 & 2 & 2\\ 
2 & 2 &  x
\end{array}
\right]
\]
\end{enumerate}}
