{Counterclockwise rotation in two dimensions about an arbitrary point, $P$, can be done by a translation (moving $P$ to the origin), rotation about the origin (through matrix multiplication as in the last problem), and then retranslation (of the origin back to $P$) . 

Rotate the point $(x,y) = (-2,3)$ counterclockwise about the point $(1,3)$ by each of $\theta = 30^{\circ}, 90^\circ$ and $200^\circ$ and give the final positions in each case.}
