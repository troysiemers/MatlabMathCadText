{In the exercises for chapter \ref{chapter:matlabmatrices} there is an exercise dealing with the theory of splines in which you are to find values $S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4$ and $S_5$. Using the equations from that exercise, set up a given/find block to solve for the $S$ values if the initial guesses are $S_1=S_2=-100$ and $S_3=S_4=S_5=0$.
