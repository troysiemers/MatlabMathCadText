{The escape velocity from a planet is given by $v~=~\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{2GM}{R}}$ where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass and $R$ is the radius of the planet.  Compute the escape velocity of both earth and the moon using an online source to find the constants.  In each case, first define $G,M$ and $R$ and then define $v$ in terms of them.  Make sure to give the citation of your source.}
