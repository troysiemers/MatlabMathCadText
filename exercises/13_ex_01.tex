{The volume of a truncated pyramid with a square base is given by 
\[
V=\frac{1}{3} (a^2 + ab +b^2)h
\] 
where $h$ is the height, $a$ is the length of one of the sides of the base and $b$ is the length of the sides of one of the top (also a square).  
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.]Create a function in Mathcad for the volume in terms of $a,b$ and $h$.
\item[b.] Use the functon in part a to compute the volume for the values $a=5ft, b=3ft, h=10ft$. The answer should be in corresponding cubic units.
\item[c.] Use the functon in part a to compute the volume for the values $a=1m, b=0.5m, h=2m$. The answer should be in corresponding cubic units.
\end{enumerate}
