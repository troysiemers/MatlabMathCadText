{Use the data in chapter 4 exercises and a loop structure to find the length of the Analemma. }

%{In some computer programs, a loop is necessary to add a list of numbers.  Consider the cubes of the first 100 integers, $1^3, 2^3, 3^3,\cdots ,100^3$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item[a.] Create a matrix of the numbers 1 to 100 and use the \cour{sum} command to find the sum of the cubes of the numbers.
%\item[b.] Use a \cour{for} loop to find the same sum by adding the cubes of the numbers one at a time (onto a cummulative sum).
%\item[c.] A formula that you may have seen is that the sum of the cubes of the numbers from 1 to $n$ is given by 
%$\displaystyle \frac{n^2 (n+1)^2}{4}$.  Confirm your sum in the previous parts using this formula.
%\end{enumerate}}
