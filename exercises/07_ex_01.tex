{In some computer programs, a loop is necessary to add a list of numbers.  Consider the cubes of the first 100 integers, $1^3, 2^3, 3^3,\cdots ,100^3$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Create a matrix of the numbers 1 to 100 and use the \cour{sum} command to find the sum of the cubes of the numbers.
\item[b.] Use a \cour{for} loop to find the same sum by adding the cubes of the numbers one at a time (onto a cumulative sum).
\item[c.] A formula that you may have seen is that the sum of the cubes of the numbers from 1 to $n$ is given by 
$\displaystyle \frac{n^2 (n+1)^2}{4}$.  Confirm your sum in the previous parts using this formula.
\end{enumerate}}

%{Modify your \cour{RemoveRow} Function from the previous homework in two ways (you should have two different functions)
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item[a.] Use an \cour{if} statement to have an error message displayed if the user enters an invalid row.  Then prompt them to enter a new row number.  In your prompt, you must indicate the allowable range of rows.  Here they only have one chance to re-enter the row.
%\item[b.]Use a \cour{while} loop so that if the user enters an invalid row on their first try, they will be able to continue to enter rows until they enter a correct value.  Again, in your prompt, you must indicate the allowable range of rows. 
%\end{enumerate}}
