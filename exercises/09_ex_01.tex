{The volume (in $m^3$) and pressure (in kPa) of a gas at a constant temperature is recorded in the table as
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Volume} & {\bf Pressure} \\ \hline
1&	2494\\ \hline
2&	1247\\ \hline
3&	831\\ \hline
4&	623\\ \hline
5&	499\\ \hline
6&	416\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Use the \cour{polyfit} and \cour{polyval} commands to find the first, second, third, and fourth-order approximating polynomials.
\item[b.] Plot the data from the table along with the curves that you found in part {\bf a}.  Make sure the curves are smooth, the plot is well labeled and there is a legend describing the different curves.
\end{enumerate}}
