{In this exercise, you will be comparing the capabilities of the if$\backslash$else and switch$\backslash$case structures by creating two programs.  In each program, prompt the user to enter the last name of one of the last 10 presidents of the United States.  Your program should display an informative sentence in response (including the presidency number and when he served), or display an error message if the entered name is invalid.  In the first program, use an if$\backslash$else structure and in the second program, use a switch$\backslash$case structure. Note: you will need to know how to compare strings (look in the help files). }
