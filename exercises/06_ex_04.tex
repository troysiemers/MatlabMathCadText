{Data on the Federal GDP and Deficit (as a percentage of GDP) is in a file called \cour{GDPAndDeficitByYear.xlsx} (in the Appendix in Table \ref{table:GDPDeficit} and saved on Angel).  First save this file to a directory on your computer and then use the command \cour{xlsread} to load this file.  Assign the data in the file to a variable of your choice and create a plot of year (1st column) versus GDP (2nd column, in billions of dollars) including appropriate titles and labels on the axes.  Use \cour{ginput} for the user to click on the first time the GDP exceeds \$10 trillion.  Use \cour{fprintf} to display the information in a useful way.}
