{Consider a triangle $ABC$.  Suppose the length of the sides $AB$ and $AC$ are 3 and 4, resp.  Let $\theta$ denote the angle at the vertex $A$.  Use the law of cosines to create a table with two columns: the first column containing $\theta$ in increments of 10 degrees from 0 to 180 degrees and the second column containing the length of the side $BC$.  First define the variables $AB, AC$ and $\theta$ and then define $BC$ in terms of them.
What is the average length of $BC$ for $\theta$ between 20 and 150 degrees?}
