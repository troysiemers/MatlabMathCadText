{The double logistic curve is defined by 
\[
y1(x)=\textrm{sign}(x-5)\cdot\left(1-\exp\left[-\left(\frac{x-5}{50}\right)^2\right]\right)
\]
and a scaled logistic curve is defined by
\[
y2(x)=\frac{5}{3+3\exp\left(-\frac{x}{10}\right)} - \frac{5}{6}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Plot $y1(x)$ and $y2(x)$ on the same graph (adjusting $x$ from $-100$ to $100$).  Format $y1(x)$ as a thick dotted line and $y2(x)$ as a thick dashed curve. Add an appropriate title.
\item[b.] Use the trace functionality (right click on the graph) to find when each plot reaches a $y$ value of $\frac{1}{2}$.  Write a sentence below the plot giving this information.
\item[E.C.] Use solve or given/find blocks to check your answers to part b.
\end{enumerate}
