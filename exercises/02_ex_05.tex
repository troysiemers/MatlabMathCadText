{Rotation in 3-dimensions is a more difficult process.  For example, if you rotate the point $(1,0,0)$ counterclockwise around the $z$ axis, you will arrive at the point $(0,1,0)$.  Look up (online) for the matrix that corresponds how to rotate by an angle $\theta$ around the $z$ axis in 3D and make sure you cite the online source.  Implement this matrix to indicate the rotation of $(1,0,0)$ about the $z$ axis by $\theta$ radians for $\theta=\pi/4, \pi/2$ and $\pi/8$. }
