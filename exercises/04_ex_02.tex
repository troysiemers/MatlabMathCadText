{For the functions $y = e^{x/5}$, $y = \sin(x)$, $y = \sqrt{x}$ for $x$ between 0 and 10:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Plot all three on the same plot, but with different colors (use \cour{linspace} with enough points so that the curves look smooth).  Put in a descriptive title and add text inside the window to label the individual graphs.
\item[b.] Plot all three in the same figure window, but with each in their own subplot and each with its own descriptive title.
\end{enumerate}}
