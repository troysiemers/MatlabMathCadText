{Consider the data from the previous problem (loaded with \cour{xlsread} from the file called \cour{GDPAndDeficitByYear.xlsx}).  Now create a plot of year versus Deficit (3rd column), which is listed as a percentage of the GDP for the corresponding year.  Including appropriate titles and labels on the axes.  Use \cour{ginput} for the user to click on {\bf all} of the times the Deficit percentage has hit 10 percent and then use \cour{fprintf} to display the information in a useful way.}
