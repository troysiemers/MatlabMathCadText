{The volume (in $m^3$) and pressure (in kPa) of a gas at a constant temperature is recorded in the table as
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Volume} & {\bf Pressure} \\ \hline
1&	2494\\ \hline
2&	1247\\ \hline
3&	831\\ \hline
4&	623\\ \hline
5&	499\\ \hline
6&	416\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Find the least squares line using the \tnr{intercept} and \tnr{slope} functions and plot it along with the data points. Add an appropriate title.
\item[b.] Use the \tnr{linfit} command to find the second-order approximating polynomial.  Plot it along with the data points and add an appropriate title.
\item[c.] Use the \tnr{linfit} command to find the third-order approximating polynomial.  Plot it along with the data points and add an appropriate title.
\end{enumerate}
