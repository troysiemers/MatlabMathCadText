{The volume of a truncated pyramid with a square base is given by $V=\frac{1}{3} (a^2 + ab +b^2)h$ where $h$ is the height, $a$ is the length of one of the sides of the base and $b$ is the length of the sides of one of the top (also a square).  
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Use the solve command to isolate the variable $b$ in terms of $V,a$ and $h$.
\item[b.] If $b=1 ft, h=10 ft$ and $V=100ft^3$, use a given/find block (and a guess for the value of $a$) to find the value of $a$.  Make sure your answer is in feet.
\end{enumerate}
